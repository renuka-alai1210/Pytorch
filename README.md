# Pytorch
PyTorch is an open source machine learning library used for developing and training neural network based deep learning models.

# Advantages of PyTorch
1. It is easy to debug and understand the code.

2. It includes many layers as Torch.

3. It includes lot of loss functions.

4. It can be considered as NumPy extension to GPUs.

5. It allows building networks whose structure is dependent on computation itself.

# Install PyTorch
conda install pytorch-cpu -c pytorch
